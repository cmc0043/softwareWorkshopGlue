The “git_quick_reference” is a quick reference guide for commonly used git commands.

The “solution_only” file/directory contains only solutions to the challenge at the end of the first day.  The “solution_and_notes” directory contains a file with notes and helpful descriptions, in addition to a second challenge: automating the task completely, i.e. running the script and having it determine which files were faulty and correct them.  

This seems like a daunting task, but it is doable by analyzing the problem, and solving it in small segments.  There are multiple ways to accomplish this, but a solution is at the end of the file and can be copied and pasted into a new file to be run in the Bash shell.

Since it appeared that most people finished the R exercises at the end of day 2, the R_Practice_folder was set up to provide additional exercises for practice.  Practice is essential to get better at R, as well as taking breaks.  A good rule of thumb is if you can’t type correctly, it’s time for a break.  If anyone needs assistance with the R exercises or the Bash scripting exercises, either during the Software Carpentry Workshop or the ones that I have provided, you can contact me at disulfidebond@gmail.com
