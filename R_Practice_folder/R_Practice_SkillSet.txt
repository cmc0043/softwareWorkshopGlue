R Practice Skill set I

Part A:
The scientists in the SuperScience® Lab believe they have just discovered a 
new weight loss food, the Super-Awesome-Growth Food (SAG).  To test its 
efficacy, one group of mice were fed SAG food for 4 weeks, while a second 
group were fed normal rodent chow.  The scientists are testing that mice who 
are fed SAG food will not have a higher weight gain than mice who are fed the 
usual rodent chow.

A1: Create a bar chart of the average weight gain of mice in the SAG 
group from week 1 to week 4.

A2: Create a bar chart of the average weight gain of mice in both the SAG and control groups from week 1 to week 4.  Hint: this will take some 
data manipulation in Excel or R first.

A3: Create a dot plot of the average weight of the animals from week 1 to 
week 4.  Use both different colors and shapes to distinguish between the 
SAG group and the Control group animals.

A4: Create a dot plot of the weight of all animals from week 1 to week 4.  
Use any color or shape you wish to distinguish between the groups. Then, do a 
student’s t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant 
difference in week 4 between the weight in the Control and the SAG group.
