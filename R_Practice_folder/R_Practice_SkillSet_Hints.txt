Hints for Practice Skill set I, Part A

A1: Review the presentation and your notes.  You are plotting x versus y.  
x is the independent variable
y is the dependent variable
Use geom_bar(stat=“identity”) if you use ggplot()


A2:  This dataset will take some manipulation, either in Excel or R 
(Excel is recommended).  As in A1, you are plotting x and y, and you can 
convert variables that may not go together as well or look very good into a 
factor (this will be very important in later skill sets).  For example, if you
 had time points 1, 2, and 4, you could change time into a categorical 
variable using factor().  R would then assess the category time for x, and 
the y variable, and plot only time points 1, 2, and 4, but not leave a gap for
 time point 3.

You don’t have to use factor, although it’s important to get a peak at it now,
 but you will have to somehow sort the data into one continuous variable, and 
two categorical variables.  

A3/A4: Use a similar method from A2, but remember to use geom_point() for a 
dot plot.  Use ??ttest to figure out which test you should use in R (there are
 more than one, bonus points if you can figure out the best test to use).

Although there are more than one possible answer, a solution set will be 
uploaded sometime next week, along with a second practice skill set.
