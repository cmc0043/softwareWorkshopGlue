# Review exercises for Terminal and R, Day One
# The following exercises will help you review how to run commands in Terminal
# and can be saved and used later when building more complex scripts
# note that each exercise has more than one solution 

# Terminal
# 1 How many lines are in a fasta file?
# 2 How could a whitespace be removed from the file?
# 3 How could a file be previewed?
# 4 How could a csv file be converted to a tab-delimited file? 
#	Hint 1: This is not a tricky as it sounds, one or two commands can do it
# 	Hint 2: Lookup the "translate" command


# R exercises
# 1 How could I enter the following dataset into R?
# CtrlAnimal 1: 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1
# CtrlAnimal 2: 5, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1
# CtrlAnimal 3: 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 1
# TrtAnimal 1: 8, 6, 4, 2, 9, 5, 4
# TrtAnimal 2: 9, 8, 8, 9, 7, 9, 7
# TrtAnimal 3: 7, 7, 9, 8, 7, 9, 5
# 2 What is the average weight for the control animals? treated animals?
# 3 Is there a significant difference between treated and untreated?  (hint: lookup t.test)
# 4 Suppose that the measurements were from Day 1-7.  How could this be setup in R?
#	Hint: Remember, there is more than one way to do this, but lookup "factor"
